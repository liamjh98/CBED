# CBED Thickness Measurement

Foil thickness is measured using the TEM convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) method.

1) Use CBED image of a known two-beam condition.
2) Open FIJI (ImageJ) or any other program to measure the Kossel-MÃ¶llenstedt (K-M) fringes.
3) Input the data into the python script (`Data` and `Index` variables).
4) Set `n = 1` to start and then iterate to generate straight line.
5) Calculate thickness / plot the data.
